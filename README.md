# Determining the Physics behind a Perfect Backflip through Tricking

The purpose for this research was to analyze the physics behind the sport of [Tricking](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tricking). This was done using an HD Camera to videotape our Tricking expert, Jon Hatchell, completing a series of backflips. During these videos, Jon had a several pieces of colorful tape attached to key parts of his body (Upper Arm, Lower Arm, Head, Waist, Upper Leg and Lower Leg). These parts of the body each have their own center of masses. Through finding the center of mass for each of these body parts, it was then possible to determine the overall center of mass for Jon throughout the backflip. The purpose of the tape was to be able to see the identify these body parts when uploaded into the program Tracker. After analyzing the videos within tracker it was found that there are three specific parts to a backflip:

	(1) **Take Off**- ∆t during the jumpe while the foot is in contact with the floor

	(2) **Flight**- ∆t in the air (no contact with the floor)

	(3) **Landing**- ∆t when contacting the floor after flight, while stopping

From this, it was possible to determine the force and torque needed to complete the perfect backflip. 

## Coding Style

All coding was completed in Jupyter Notebook (Jupyter - an acronym meaning Python). Below in the "Notebooks" section are links to each jupyter notebook used during the research. Within each jupyter notebook are notes to help walk you through what the code means.
